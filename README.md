# Front-end Documentation

## Overall
According to the test requirement, no runtime third-part library or framework is used on this project but tools for development are used such as ESlint, Babel, Webpack and its corresponding toolchain like various kinds of loaders. To boost productivity, I create a custom React-like library for building the interactive user interface which is called "Veact" for this project, the source code of this library is stored in the /src/lib folder. And the library is hosted on another repository under my github, detailed [documentation](https://github.com/77Vincent/veact) is available there.
